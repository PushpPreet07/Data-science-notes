Temporal Pattern Anomalies
Unusual timing patterns - HNW individuals typically have predictable transaction rhythms. Look for:

Transactions at unusual hours (middle of night, holidays)
Sudden clustering of large transactions in short time windows
Deviation from historical day-of-week or month patterns
Transactions during known personal absence periods (vacations, medical leave)

Frequency deviations - Create features around transaction cadence:

Sudden spikes or drops in transaction frequency
Changes in average time between transactions
Unusual dormancy periods followed by high activity

Relationship and Network Anomalies
New beneficiary patterns - Since HNW clients often have established networks:

First-time beneficiaries receiving large amounts
Transactions to beneficiaries with no prior relationship history
Geographic outliers in beneficiary locations
Beneficiaries with unusual account characteristics (new accounts, offshore entities)

Beneficiary concentration shifts - Look for changes in:

Sudden concentration of funds to single beneficiaries
Deviation from typical beneficiary diversification patterns
Unusual beneficiary types (individual vs. corporate vs. trust patterns)

Transaction Value and Pattern Anomalies
Amount-based anomalies - Even with high-value transactions:

Amounts just below regulatory reporting thresholds (potential structuring)
Unusual round numbers or specific amount patterns
Transactions significantly larger than historical maximums
Sudden changes in typical transaction size distributions

Sequential transaction patterns - Look for:

Rapid-fire transactions to same beneficiaries
Layered transactions (complex routing patterns)
Mirror transactions (offsetting flows)
Transaction amounts that sum to specific totals

Account Behavior Anomalies
Cross-account coordination - If clients have multiple accounts:

Synchronized activity across accounts
Unusual fund movement patterns between accounts
Coordinated timing of transactions from different accounts

Balance management anomalies - Changes in:

Account balance maintenance patterns
Cash flow timing relative to known income/investment cycles
Unusual account funding sources

Geographic and Jurisdictional Red Flags
Location-based anomalies - Transactions involving:

High-risk jurisdictions or tax havens
Sudden geographic diversification of beneficiaries
Transactions to locations with no business/personal connection
Routing through unusual correspondent banking relationships

Behavioral Consistency Anomalies
Communication pattern changes - If you have interaction data:

Changes in transaction authorization methods
Unusual urgency or pressure in transaction requests
Deviations from normal communication channels

Seasonal/cyclical deviations - Look for:

Transactions that don't align with known tax planning cycles
Unusual activity during typically quiet periods
Deviations from investment/business cycle patterns

Implementation Suggestions
Create composite anomaly scores combining multiple factors, as sophisticated financial crimes often involve multiple subtle deviations rather than single obvious red flags. Consider using:

Rolling window statistics to capture evolving baselines
Peer group comparisons among similar HNW clients
Machine learning models that can detect complex interaction patterns between features



Net amount volatility spikes compared to rolling averages
Daily absolute volume spikes (e.g., >3 standard deviations from mean)
Unusual clustering of same-direction transactions
Transfer timing patterns that suggest coordination across accounts
Sudden spike in number of currencies used per day
Use of currencies with no historical precedent
Currency combinations that don't align with client's geographic footprint
High absolute volume with low net amount (classic churning indicator)
